# SpaceTrackapi
Space Track API call for specific satellites or satellite groupings. This file also includes the parsing of necessary TLE data into neat JSON format for orbital visualization. 

This script is subjective to your needs and can be easily adjusted accordingly. I have tested the commands used up to 100 satellites with no data loss.
